  Abstract = {
	  Incomplete treatment of patients with infectious 
	tuberculosis (TB) may not only lead to relapse but also to the development 
	of 
	antibiotic resistant TB-one of the most serious health problems facing 
	society today. In this article, we formulate one-strain and two-strain TB 
	models to determine possible mechanisms that may allow for the survival and 
	spread of naturally resistant strains of TB as well as antibiotic-generated 
	resistant strains of TB. Analysis of our models shows that non-antibiotic 
	co-existence is possible but rare for naturally resistant strains while 
	co-existence is almost the rule for strains that result from the lack of 
	compliance with antibiotic treatment by TB infected individuals.

  Abstract                 = {Whether the development of active tuberculosis in 
  people with previous tuberculous infection represents an episode of 
  endogenous reactivation or exogenous reinfection has been debated for 
  decades. Articles proposing the unitary concept of pathogenesis of 
  tuberculosis in the 1960s initiated a period in which reinfection was 
  considered to be an uncommon cause of tuberculosis. To review evidence 
  demonstrating the occurrence of tuberculosis due to exogenous reinfection, we 
  did a literature search covering publications from 1966 until the present, 
  and found that there was substantial evidence - both experimental and 
  epidemiological - supporting the role of exogenous reinfection in 
  tuberculosis. However, only models based on estimates of the annual risk of 
  infection and the incidence of tuberculosis provided a quantitative estimate 
  of the relative contribution of exogenous reinfection to the burden of 
  tuberculosis. Better estimates of the contribution of exogenous reinfection 
  to new cases of tuberculosis may need to be considered in tuberculosis 
  control strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads 
  to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary 
  progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or 
  exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies 
  show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant 
  route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for 
  public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type 
  of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular 
  epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of 
  recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not 
  possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and 
  re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of 
  re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the 
  parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that 
  exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic 
  assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally 
  likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical 
  studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly 
  influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a 
  network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous 
  mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic 
  trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results 
  suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average 
  disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be 
  unevenly distributed in the population. These results have important 
  implications for the development of TB control strategies.},

  asymptotically stable; whereas if ??? 0 {\textgreater} 1, then it is 
  unstable. Thus, ??? 0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of 
  the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and 
  stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for ??? 0 near one. 
  This criterion, together with the definition of ??? 0, is illustrated by 
  treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models 
  and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for 
  disease control. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recurrence of tuberculosis (TB) can be the consequence of relapse or 
exogenous reinfection. The study aimed to assess the factors associated with 
exogenous TB reinfection. Prospective cohort study based on the TB database, 
maintained at the Division of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital (Milan, 
Italy). Time period: 1995-2010. Inclusion criteria: (1) a parts per thousand 
yen2 episodes of culture-confirmed TB; (2) cure of the first episode of TB; (3) 
availability of one Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate for each episode. 
Genotyping of the M. tuberculosis strains to differentiate relapse and 
exogenous 
reinfection. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of 
risk factors on exogenous reinfections. Of the 4682 patients with TB, 83 were 
included. Of these, exogenous reinfection was diagnosed in 19 (23 {\%}). It was 
independently associated with absence of multidrug resistance at the first 
episode [0, 10 (0.01-0.95), p = 0.045] and with prolonged interval between the 
first TB episode and its recurrence [7.38 (1.92-28.32) p = 0.004]. However, TB 
relapses occurred until 4 years after the first episode. The risk associated 
with being foreign born, extrapulmonary site of TB, and HIV infection was not 
statistically significant. In the relapse and re-infection cohort, one-third of 
the patients showed a worsened drug resistance profile during the recurrent TB 
episode. Exogenous TB reinfections have been documented in low endemic areas, 
such as Italy. A causal association with HIV infection could not be confirmed. 
Relapses and exogenous reinfections shared an augmented risk of multidrug 
resistance development, frequently requiring the use of second-line anti-TB 
regimens.},

abstract = {The authors used epidemiologic data on tuberculosis to construct a 
model for the time delay from initial latent infection to active disease, when 
infection transmission occurs. They used case rate tables in the United States 
to calculate the fractional rate of change per annum (A) in the incidence of 
active tuberculosis. They then derived estimates for the effective reproductive 
number (R) and the cumulative transmission, defined as the number of people 
whom one infected person will infect in his or her lifetime and over many 
multiple successive transmissions, respectively. For A of -4 percent per year, 
the average US condition from 1930 to 1995, they estimate the reproductive 
number to be about 0.55 and the cumulative transmission to be about 1.2. The 
estimated rate of the new latent infections in the United States is 80,000 per 
year, the estimated prevalence of latent infections is 5 percent, and the 
number of transmissions of infection per active case is 3.5. From the model, 
the authors predicted active case rates in various age groups and compared them 
with published tables. The comparison suggests that the risk of activation 
decreases rapidly, then gradually, for the first 10 years after initial 
infection; the risk is relatively constant from 10 to 40 years and may decrease 
again after 40 years. The authors also discuss how this model can be used to 
help make decisions about tuberculosis control measures in the population.},
